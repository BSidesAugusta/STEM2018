# BSidesAugusta STEM 2018
BSidesAugusta STEM is a workshop focused on developing interest in computers, programming, and electronics in the Central Savannah River Area (CSRA) youth.  Local youth will learn skills for the future through fun and innovative activities.  This exciting workshop is designed to teach children, grades 7-10, to interface with a Raspberry Pi and peripherals.  Students will learn to setup the Raspberry Pi hardware, configure the Raspian Operating System, connect General Input/Output devices, and program the operating system to interact with those devices.  Students will spend the afternoon in a team practical application exercise.
